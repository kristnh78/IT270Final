                                    <p>Sarah came to rescue as a stray found in Virginia. Her name was given him by the Shelter. She is working on learning it and seems to welcome some encouragement from a simple clap of the hands when calling her. She has been neutered and is UTD on vacinations.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Sarah is housebroken. She will let you know when he needs to go out. She does like to go out in the morning and after every meal.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Sarah knows, "Sit", "Stay" and will offer her paw for a treat. She has a very sweet disposition and loves being near you at all times. She is eager to please and will look to you for praise and confirmation that she is a part of your life.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        As noted above, Sarah was found as a stray. Her current foster does not have a fenced yard, and while she is doing quite well with leash walking, her new home will need a fenced yard.
                                    </p>
